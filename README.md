> **"Chronology Protection via Quantum Extremal Islands: A Unitary Resolution Without Dynamical Excision"**  
> arXiv: under-refree

We demonstrate that closed timelike curve (CTC) interiors in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity constitute quantum extremal islands whose entropy is regulated by replica wormhole saddles. Using analytic continuation from Euclidean time circles, we compute the island location $\rho_* \approx 0.728\,T$ inside the chronology horizon and show finite generalized entropy without dynamical excision.

## Key Results

- **Analytical solution:** Quantum extremal surface at $\rho_*^3 = \frac{3\phi_r}{4Gc}(T^2 - \rho_*^2)$
- **Numerical verification:** For $c=12$, $\phi_r=10^3 G$, $T=10G$ → $\rho_* = 7.28\,G$
- **Page curve behavior:** Generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(\rho_*) = 37.2$ (finite)
- **Semiclassical regime:** Island dominates when $Gc/\phi_r \ll 1$
